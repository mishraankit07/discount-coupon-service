Assumption in bxGy coupon type <br/>
when we say B2G1 type coupon then I am assuming
any quantity of items of 1 type are free for the user.

if buy array [X, Y, Z] and “get” array [A, B, C]
and in the cart we have [X, Y, A] with coupon type B2G1
then any quantity of A in the cart is free for the user.
